# HCDS 512 Assignment 1 - Bias in Data

# Goal of the Project
The goal of this assignment is to explore the concept of bias through data on Wikipedia articles - specifically, articles on political figures from a variety of countries. In this project, I combined a dataset of Wikipedia articles with a dataset of country populations (`WPDS_2020_data.csv` and `page_data.csv`), and used a machine learning service called ORES to estimate the quality of each article. I performed an analysis of how the coverage of politicians on Wikipedia and the quality of articles about politicians varies between countries. My analysis will consist of a series of tables that show:
*  the countries with the greatest and least coverage of politicians on Wikipedia compared to their population.
*  the countries with the highest and lowest proportion of high quality articles about politicians.
*  a ranking of geographic regions by articles-per-person and proportion of high quality articles.


# APIs

# Model
We're using a machine learning system called ORES. This was originally an acronym for "Objective Revision Evaluation Service" but was simply renamed “ORES”. ORES is a machine learning tool that can provide estimates of Wikipedia article quality. The article quality estimates are, from best to worst:
1.   FA - Featured article
2.   List item
3.   GA - Good article
4.   B - B-class article
5.   C - C-class article
6.   Start - Start-class article
7.   Stub - Stub-class article

These were learned based on articles in Wikipedia that were peer-reviewed using the Wikipedia content assessment procedures. These quality classes are a sub-set of quality assessment categories developed by Wikipedia editors. For more details, please see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Content_assessment.

In this project, we are using ORES client, which is licensed under the MIT license. Please see https://github.com/wikimedia/ores for installation instructions.


# Curated Data

The processed data are stored into a single CSV file, `wp_wpds_politicians_by_country.csv`, with the following headers:
*  country
*  article_name
*  revision_id
*  article_quality_est.
*  population

Please see the data cleaning process in the notebook `hcds-a2-bias.ipynb`.
